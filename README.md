## Running the Skeleton Code

### Running the Code Locally

After activating your conda environment, run the following command:

```
python main.py <model name>
```

To run on test code, run the following command instead: 
```
python main.py <model name> -t
```

### Running the Code on Google Colab

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zkxwgDItHv92iD07M8o8FlfJ0ZxLUDly?usp=sharing) will walk you through setting the skeleton code up on Google Colab.

**Note:** Google Colab may terminate your session after a few hours, so it may be a better idea to run your code on Kaggle (see below).
